# MIPS-Assembly-Examples
Simple Examples (commented in Italian!)
Learn to code in Assembly for the MIPS processor with these codes.

You'll find quick examples about:
* vectors
* matrices / 2D arrays
* sorting algorithms
* recursion

## Disclaimer
The codes I'm sharing can present errors and I can't assume that they're super optimized for performances and so on...
If you find errors and you can use Github you can fix the bugs. Thank you!

## What is MIPS
MIPS stands for "microprocessor without interlocked pipeline stages", it' s a cheap processor born in 1985.
It' s mostly used in Game Consoles (Playstation 1 and 2, PSP, Nintendo64) and Windows CE devices (car navigators and so on).
There are different MISP models/versions. So when we talk about MIPS, we're referring to the MIPS family processors most of the times.

## What is Assembly
It's a programming language. Being a low-level language it's very powerful and "very close" to machine code. So it varies depending on the architecture you're developing on.
